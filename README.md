# React + Vite


Using React, Tailwind CSS, xenova to create a web app to transcribe, and then translate, audio files.  These files can either be uploaded as mp3 files, or recorded with the record feature on the homepage. 

This project is part of a 'coding-along' project tutorial, not my own code, but written and put into practice as a way of further understanding React from more than online codecademy tutorials.  

Tutorial used; smoljames React.js course. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
